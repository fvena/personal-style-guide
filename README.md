## üí° Motivation

Write one or two paragraphs describing the purpose of your library and what motivated you to develop it.

What problem does this library solve? Why is it better than existing alternatives?

## üöÄGetting Started

### Prerequisites

ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint, Typescript are a peer dependency, so you need to install at the root of your project:

```sh
npm install --save-dev eslint prettier stylelint typescript
```

### Installation

To install the package, run:

```sh
npm install --save-dev style-guide
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### ESLint

You need to extend one or both of the following configurations.

- `style-guide/eslint/browser` for browser projects.
- `style-guide/eslint/node` for Node projects.

Create or update `eslint.config.js` in your project root and extend the configurations you need:

```js
import eslintNode from "style-guide/eslint/node";

export default [...eslintNode];
```

## Prettier

To use the shared Prettier config, create or update `.prettierrc.config.js` in your project root:

```js
import prettierConfig from "style-guide/prettier";

export default prettierConfig;
```

## Stylelint

Create or update `stylelint.config.js` in your project root:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ["style-guide/stylelint"],
};
```

## TypeScript

This style guide provides multiple TypeScript configs. These configurations are based on the environment you are working on, so you need to extend one of the following configurations:

- `style-guide/typescript/node`.
- `style-guide/typescript/browser`.

Ensure you have a `tsconfig.json` in your project root. You can extend the provided configuration if necessary:

```json
{
  "extends": "style-guide/typescript/node"
}
```

## Scripts

Add the following scripts to your `package.json` to lint and format your code:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint:js": "eslint 'src/**/*.{js,ts,vue}'",
    "lint:css": "stylelint 'src/**/*.{scss,css}'",
    "format": "prettier --write 'src/**/*.{js,ts,vue,scss,css}'"
  }
}
```

## Updating

To check for outdated dependencies, run:

```bash
npx npm-check-updates
```

This lists all outdated dependencies. It's important to read the release notes for each dependency to understand the changes.

Update dependencies running the interactive mode. It's recommended to update them one by one to avoid breaking changes.:

```bash
npx npm-check-updates --interactive
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

When starting a project, we often aim for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as quickly as possible, but there are always ideas left for later or parts that need refactoring for better performance.

Having a public roadmap for your project is always a good idea. It lets you pick up where you left off after a break and gives users confidence in an actively maintained library.

Additionally, users who know your development plans can suggest changes, ideas, or collaborations.

Use checkboxes to show progress on your roadmap.

- [] Feature 1
- [] Improve performance of X
- [] Add advanced documentation

## ü§ù Contributions

Explain how users can contribute to your library, typically:

Reporting bugs
Fixing bugs
Adding new features
Sharing on social media
Becoming an official contributor
Making a small donation

## üìú License

Indicating the type of license for your project helps others know what they can and cannot do with it. You can find templates for all types of licenses here: <https://opensource.org/licenses>. Choose wisely, as this will determine how others can use your library.

In my case, I am developing open-source code and using the MIT license, which allows users to do almost anything with the code.

## üôå Footer

This is the closing section of your README. You can be creative here: introduce yourself, thank users for their interest, or ask them to give the project a star.
